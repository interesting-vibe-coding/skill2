# MVP

## Goal

Build the smallest loop that helps maintain one real skill library.

Target repo:

```bash
~/workspace/my-agent-config
```

## Scope

### 1. scan

Input: `skills/` directory.

Output:

- skill name
- path
- description
- body token estimate
- references
- scripts
- frontmatter issues
- missing internal references
- duplicate or overlapping trigger text

### 2. usage

Input:

- Codex logs: `~/.codex/archived_sessions/*.jsonl`
- later: Claude/OpenCode hooks

Rules:

- count only current hub paths: `~/workspace/my-agent-config/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- ignore `.codex/plugins/cache`
- ignore `.codex/vendor_imports`
- ignore old `workspace/My-Skills`

Initial event type:

- any target `SKILL.md` path in a session log = activation candidate

Later split:

- real invocation
- maintenance edit
- broad scan
- worker read

### 3. report

Generate local HTML:

- high-frequency skills
- low-frequency skills
- never-used skills
- recently edited but unused skills
- large skills
- overlapping trigger descriptions
- missing references
- merge/downgrade candidates

### 4. suggest

Initial rules:

- never used + no project owner -> delete candidate
- low usage + only used through one parent -> downgrade to reference
- high co-activation + overlapping descriptions -> merge candidate
- project-specific path/name/content -> projectize candidate
- high usage + long body -> split references/scripts

## Success Criteria

- `skill2 scan ~/workspace/my-agent-config/skills` emits useful JSON.
- `skill2 usage --codex ~/.codex` extracts at least one real skill path signal.
- `skill2 report` creates readable local HTML.
- `skill2 suggest` reproduces the `agent-search` consolidation decision.

## Non-Goals

- SaaS.
- Hosted telemetry.
- Replacing Codex/Claude skill discovery.
- Marketplace search.
- Automatic deletion without human review.
