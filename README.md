## Why Skill2

Writing one Agent Skill is easy. Maintaining twenty is harder.

As your library grows, three questions matter:

- Does it trigger when it should—and stay quiet when it should not?
- Does it improve the outcome?
- Should it stay, be revised, or enter cleanup review?

Skill2 treats Agent Skills as testable, auditable software units. Five focused Skills help agents create, test, audit, package, and visualize a library—while deterministic scripts keep evidence reproducible and local.

## Install

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add MisterBrookT/skill2
/plugin install skill2@skill2-marketplace
```

Installs five self-contained Skills.

### Codex

```bash
npx skills add MisterBrookT/skill2 -g -a codex -y
```

Copies the five self-contained Skills for Codex.

### Manual fallback

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MisterBrookT/skill2.git ~/.skill2 && ~/.skill2/install.sh
```

Copies Skills only (`install.sh` supports `--dry-run` and conflict-gated `--force` from a checkout). Requires Git. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is needed only when a Skill runs its deterministic script. Skill scripts use `uv run --script`; first run may fetch declared dependencies into the uv cache; offline use requires a warm cache. Data stays local; no hosted service, telemetry, or PyPI install for users.

## Five focused Skills

| Skill | Agent uses it when |
| --- | --- |
| `skill2-create` | Creating, updating, or restructuring a skill. |
| `skill2-test` | Testing activation and outcome in isolation. |
| `skill2-package` | Packaging, documenting, and optionally publishing a Skill repository. |
| `skill2-audit` | Finding contract, safety, and behavior gaps. |
| `skill2-visualize` | Viewing inventory, direct calls, zero-use candidates, test status, and conservative lifecycle review candidates. |

## Try it

Ask the agent directly:

```text
Create a project-level skill for this workflow.
Audit this skill library and show only evidence-backed findings.
Visualize which skills are called directly and which have zero direct calls.
```

## Local-first evidence

Skill2 visualizes skill inventory and usage from local agent session logs. Data stays on your machine; prompts and transcripts are never included.

## Design

Skills are the product; deterministic scripts support them. The repository dogfoods every rule it teaches. Package defaults to native distribution and adds artifact or release work only when requested. Visualize never changes a library.

Skill2 thanks these projects and their maintainers. Their work shaped this repository's architecture and design principles.

## Development

Contributor and CI use the checkout CLI. This is not a user install step:

```bash
uv sync
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv run ruff check .
uv run skill2 lint skills
uv run skill2 package-check .
```
