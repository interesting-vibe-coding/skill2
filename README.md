## Install

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add MisterBrookT/skill2
/plugin install skill2@skill2-marketplace
```

Installs six self-contained Skills.

### Codex

```bash
npx skills add MisterBrookT/skill2 -g -a codex -y
```

Copies the six self-contained Skills for Codex. A curated `/plugins` listing is [under review](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/32820).

### Manual fallback

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MisterBrookT/skill2.git ~/.skill2 && ~/.skill2/install.sh
```

Copies Skills only (`install.sh` supports `--dry-run` and conflict-gated `--force` from a checkout). Requires Git. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is needed only when a Skill runs its deterministic script. Skill scripts use `uv run --script`; first run may fetch declared dependencies into the uv cache; offline use requires a warm cache. Data stays local; no hosted service, telemetry, or PyPI install for users.

## Skill Library

| Skill | Agent uses it when |
| --- | --- |
| `skill2-create` | Creating, updating, or restructuring a skill. |
| `skill2-test` | Testing activation and outcome in isolation. |
| `skill2-package` | Producing an installable candidate without remote writes. |
| `skill2-publish` | Preparing README, release, and public install checks. |
| `skill2-audit` | Finding contract, safety, and behavior gaps. |
| `skill2-visualize` | Viewing inventory, direct calls, zero-use candidates, test status, and conservative lifecycle review candidates. |

Ask the agent directly:

```text
Create a project-level skill for this workflow.
Audit this skill library and show only evidence-backed findings.
Visualize which skills are called directly and which have zero direct calls.
```

## Local Evidence

Skill2 scans local Agent session logs for exact `SKILL.md` reads. It separates direct activation signals from broad scans, maintenance, and worker reads. APFS does not retain historical file-open counts, so Skill2 does not claim complete usage history.

Deterministic inventory and usage views run through the installed Skill-owned script:

```bash
uv run --script <skill-dir>/scripts/run -- visualize --skills ~/workspace/my-skill-library/skills --codex ~/.codex
```

Use `--json` for structured agent or script input. Low frequency is evidence, not a deletion decision. Output contains no prompt or transcript content.

## Design

Skills are the product; deterministic scripts support them. The repository dogfoods every rule it teaches. Package never publishes. Publish requires dry-run and explicit confirmation. Visualize never changes a library.

| Area | Prior art | Adopted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill format | [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification), [Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | Portable `SKILL.md`, progressive disclosure, owned resources. |
| Authoring | [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), [writing-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/main/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md) | Skills-first structure, trigger-first descriptions, dogfood. |
| Evaluation | [Superpowers evals](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/superpowers-evals), [Tripwire](https://github.com/bharath31/tripwire), [Waza](https://github.com/microsoft/waza), [skill-eval](https://github.com/fede0089/skill-eval), [agent-skills-eval](https://github.com/darkrishabh/agent-skills-eval), [skillci](https://github.com/tolztoy/skillci), [skill-distill](https://github.com/lov-alt/skill-distill) | Isolated runs, positive/negative routing, baseline, deterministic assertions. |
| Packaging | [agent-scripts](https://github.com/steipete/agent-scripts), [awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot), [scientific-agent-skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills), [superpowers-marketplace](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace), [Caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman), [OpenAI Plugins](https://github.com/openai/plugins) | Idempotent installs, conflict gates, marketplace manifests, CI. |

Skill2 thanks these projects and their maintainers. Their work shaped this repository's architecture and design principles.

## Development

Contributor and CI use the checkout CLI. This is not a user install step:

```bash
uv sync
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv run ruff check .
uv run skill2 lint skills
uv run skill2 package-check .
```
